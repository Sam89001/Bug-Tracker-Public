# Bug-Tracker-Public
Bug Tracker code for viewing! Made for learning purposes.

If you want to view the hosted code, the link is available here: https://buggy.onrender.com


|| CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS|| I would estimate the bug tracker is about 60% done, most core functionality is complete except for groups. 
Continually, the front end is not complete, it is currently very barebones as its simplified for testing purposes.


General Instruction:

This bug tracker can be used to log bugs for your project, here are the features:

-Projects: The universal project that all sprints are linked too.
-Sprints: Sections within your project so that you can break down your project to easily digestable sections.
-Groups: || IN PROGRESS || Groups that you can invite users to so that they can view the project and sprints and any bugs associated with the project.


NOT CURRENTLY WORKING:

-Groups are in progress and not currently working
-User interface is barebones but functional, will improve visually once all core functionality is working
-Project edit and delete buttons do not currently work
-Settings, notifications and profile picture on home screen either do not work or display properly.

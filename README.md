# Bug-Tracker-Public
Bug Tracker code for viewing! Made for learning purposes.

If you want to view the hosted code, the link is available here: https://buggy.onrender.com

|| CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS|| I would estimate the bug tracker is about 60% done, most core functionality is complete except for groups. 
Continually, the front end is not complete, it is currently very barebones as its simplified for testing purposes.

General Instruction:

This bug tracker can be used to log bugs for your project, here are the features:

Projects: The universal project that all sprints are linked too.
Sprints: Sections within your project so that you can break down your project to easily digestable sections.
Groups: || IN PROGRESS || Groups that you can invite users to so that they can view the project and sprints and any bugs associated with the project.
